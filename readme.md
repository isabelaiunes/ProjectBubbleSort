This project teaches how to create a Python code to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by comparing each element with the next
and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
The algorithm repeats this process multiple times until all elements are sorted.
