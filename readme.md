This project teaches how to create a Python code to implement the Bubble Sort algorithm.
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by comparing each element with the next
and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
The algorithm repeats this process multiple times until all elements are sorted.
With each pass, the largest element "floats" to the end of the array like a bubble, giving the algorithm its name.
The project begins with pseudocode and an explanation of the algorithm, and concludes with the creation of the Python code.
